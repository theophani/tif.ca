<p>I should explain the blue and red (the red looks less pinky in real
life).&nbsp; The little balls of colour in the first painting were meant
to embody the emotions of the two individuals.&nbsp; When their emotions
are revealed or inflamed they escape the balls.&nbsp; In this painting,
his emotions are embodied by the blue 'wave' that attempts to wash over
onto her, while her emotions are stagnant. 

<p>His body language indicates that he wants her to sit.&nbsp; He pulls
her in with one hand while he motions her to sit with the other.&nbsp; 
She, however, seems reluctant.&nbsp; Her body leans away from him.&nbsp; 
If she knows him so well, why is she wary? 

<p>I feel this painting was poorly executed.&nbsp; The canvas itself was
poorly prepared: it's loose on the frame and stains on the back indicate
that I didn't prime it properly.&nbsp; Everything about it was rushed.
