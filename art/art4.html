<p>She pushes away as he pulls her in, his essence crawling all over her.

<p>If you have ever seen the work of <a
href="http://www.haring.com/">Keith Haring</a>, he may come to mind at
this point.&nbsp; While I was familiar with his art when I painted this,
it was my art teacher who observed correctly when she said I seemed to be
inspired by <a href="http://markkostabi.com/">Mark Kostabi</a> (I find his
1996 <i><a href="http://markkostabi.com/paintings/ci.html">Counter
Intelligence</a></i> rather ironic).&nbsp; I feel a little guilty about
liking 'his' work because of the <a href="http://collection.nlc-bnc.ca/100/202/300/artbus/1996/artbus.b02/featureone.html">controversy</a>
surrounding him, but if you know your art history, you know that Andy
Warhol was the same way.&nbsp; Kostabi hardly paints any of 'his' works,
but his studio&nbsp; produces hundreds of paintings each year.&nbsp; If
you don't agree that he's a painter, you can at least agree that he is
some kind of genius. 

<p>This painting is my personal favourite.&nbsp; It was the first painting
in the series to turn out exactly as I had intended.&nbsp; I particularily
like the sky.
