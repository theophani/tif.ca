<p>No, I do not hate men.&nbsp; No, I am not a feminist.

<p>In the literary sense, this painting is the climax of the series.&nbsp; 
The first painting introduced the setting, the characters and something
about their relationship.&nbsp; A conflict began to build, until the
confrontation.&nbsp;  But now, it is the 'woman' who is in control.&nbsp;
The essense of the woman that dominates. 

<p>I was not building to this scene.&nbsp; I had no idea where the story
was going when I started.&nbsp; While planning the fourth painting I had
some idea how I wanted the series to end, and I had to get there
somehow.&nbsp;  I wanted it to be clear from the paintings what was
happening, and in this, the fifth painting, I wanted it to be clear that
the woman had taken action to liberate herself.&nbsp; What more clear way
to demonstrate this?&nbsp;  My point was to show that a story can be told
through body language alone, and I think this painting is pretty
straightforward. 

<p>Oh, and I don't really like this one all that much.&nbsp; I think of
it as uninspired.
