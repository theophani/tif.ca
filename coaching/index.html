                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been in the software engineering industry for over 20 years, leading teams and building
                        products that customers love. I've done a
                        bit of everything: leading, product managing, designing user experiences, coding, and analyzing
                        processes. All of this
                        has given me a 360-degree view that I bring into my coaching sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People tell me they like how I break down tricky
                        topics and make them feel confident. Let’s team up and figure things out in a relaxed and
                        supportive way.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>My Coaching Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I coach, it’s all about self-reflection and action. I listen intently to what you’re
                        struggling with and love
                        finding those “aha!” moments together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’ll dive deep into any doubts you have, figure out what standards and values truly matter to
                        you, and
                        I’ll share stories from my own journey to help you see things in a new light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal? To help you pinpoint what
                        success looks like for you and craft a plan to get there.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <h3>What I Offer</h3>
            <div class="cols">
                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                        I coach engineering leaders at all levels, from those just stepping into leadership to seasoned
                        veterans who
                        want a fresh view. With all my years of experience, I understand the unique ins and outs of our
                        industry, and I shape my
                        coaching around the reality you face.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                        I also offer group sessions for teams of engineering managers to bounce ideas off each other,
                        grow their network,
                        tackle new problems, and shape a shared way of leading. I'm there to steer the conversation and
                        sprinkle in some new
                        ideas, and to encourage the team to take the lead on their own initiatives.

                <!--  coaching -->
                <p>Tiffany’s coaching was on point. She took the lead whenever necessary without taking away the work I
                    was supposed
                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the
                    future.</p>

                <!-- facilitation -->
                <p>Tiffany is a great communicator. She is very relatable and spreads good vibes in every encounter. At
                    the same
                    time she challenges assumptions and quickly finds a precise summary for what someone meant to say.
                    She always
                    does so in an inclusive and supportive way, enabling others.</p>
