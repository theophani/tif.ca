6 PORTIONS 

          1/2 Cup Tapioca Pearls 
          1 1/2 Cups Milk 
          1 1/2 Cups Heavy Cream 
          1 Fresh Vanilla Bean 
          1/2 Cup Sugar 
          1 pinch Salt 
          2 Egg Yolks 

     Soak the pearls in water overnight, covered well with water.
     Drain the water off. Heat the milk, cream, vanilla bean
     (split and scraped), and tapioca to a slow simmer in a heavy
     pot and cook for 1 hour, stirring often. Add the sugar and salt.
     Bring to a simmer being careful not to let the tapioca
     stick to the bottom of the pan. 

     Put the yolks into a bowl and stir
     in some of the tapioca mixture to equalize
     the temperature. Add to the pan while stirring.
     Pour into a bowl and cool.
