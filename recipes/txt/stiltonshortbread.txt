This shortbread is wonderful with a little PORT JELLY spooned on top.

Ingredients:

Stilton Shortbread

1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups all purpose flour
1 cup Stilton cheese (or other blue cheese)
1/4 cup ground pecans

Directions: 

Stilton Shortbread 

Preheat oven to 325° F. Grease an 8-inch round baking pan and line with parchment paper. Cream
together butter, sugar and salt, until pale and fluffy. Stir in flour until blended. Crumble Stilton
with pecans and mix into flour mixture until just blended. Press dough evenly into bottom of
prepared pan.

Score with a sharp knife and dock with a fork. Bake at 300° F for 45 minutes to 1 hour until firm
and golden. Cut shortbread into wedges while warm, but allow to cool to room temperature before
removing from pan.
