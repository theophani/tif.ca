Cumin Crisps 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 cup all-purpose flour 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 tbsp granulated sugar 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 tbsp rice wine vinegar or other mild 
white vinegar 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 tbsp cumin seeds 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 tbsp butter, melted 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/2 cup water or more, as needed 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Preheat oven to 450F and set rack on middle level. Have ready two nonstick
baking sheets or line regular baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk or
mix together flour and sugar in a bowl, then whisk in vinegar until
smooth. Batter will be quite thick. Stir in cumin seeds and butter then
whisk again. Stir in enough water to make smooth, spreadable mixture. Let
rest 10 minutes. Drop teaspoonfuls of batter several inches apart on
baking sheet and with pastry brush or spatula, spread batter very thinly,
as thin as paper, in any shape you like. Alternately batter can be spread
paper-thin into one big sheet which can be broken, after baking, into
irregular pieces. Bake 5 to 7 minutes, until brown and crisp on edges.
Cool on baking sheets. The crackers will crisp further as they cool. Serve
immediately or store in airtight container. Makes 40 small crackers.
