Basic cooked white rice - yield: 3 cups

Use 2 cups water for soft, tnder rice or 1 3/4 to 1 7/8 cups for firmer
grains.  Use 1/4 cup less, either way, when cooking medium grain white
rice.  Do not stir except as directed, or the rice will turn gummy.

Method I:

Bring to boil in a saucepan:
	1 3/4 to 2 cups of water
	1 tablespoon of butter or vegetable oil (optional)
	1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt

Add and stir once:
	1 cup long-grain white rice

Cover and cook over very low heat until all the water is absorbed, 15 to
18 minutes.  Do not lift the cover before the end of cooking.  Let stand,
covered, for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
