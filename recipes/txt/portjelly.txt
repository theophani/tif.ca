"This recipe does call for a great deal of sugar, but such a quantity is needed for your jelly to set
properly. The clear ruby colour of this jelly is just stunning on your cheese plate! This jelly is
fabulous spooned onto Stilton Shortbread."

Ingredients:

Port Jelly

2 cups ruby port wine
3 cups sugar
