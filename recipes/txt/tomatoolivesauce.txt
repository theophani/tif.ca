I cut this out from the Toronto Star a couple months ago and have made a few times since. Since the Star said it was
from Gourmet Magazine, I got this version straight from there.

SPAGHETTI WITH SPICY TOMATO OLIVE SAUCE

Active time: 20 min Start to finish: 40 min
1/2 cup brine-cured black olives, pitted and cut lengthwise into slivers
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes, or to taste
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 (14- to 15-oz) cans stewed tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 lb spaghetti

Accompaniment: grated parmesan

Cook olives, garlic, and red pepper flakes in oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until
garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and salt and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up large
pieces of tomato, until sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

While sauce is simmering, cook spaghetti in a 6- to 8-quart pot of boiling salted water until al dente.

Drain spaghetti in a colander and add to sauce. Cook, tossing, over moderately low heat until pasta is coated, 30
seconds to 1 minute.

Makes 4 servings.
