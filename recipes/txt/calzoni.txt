Quick Calzoni 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 tube (283g) pizza dough 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
250mL (1 cup) pizza sauce 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 thin slices salami or pepperoni (each the size of a quarter) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
250mL (1 cup) grated mozzarella cheese 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Preheat oven to 220C (425F). Divide dough into two pieces and roll each
out into a thin 6-inch circle with rolling pin. Slide on to a lightly
oiled baking sheet. 

Brush half of circle lightly with pizza sauce. Top this with half of
salami and cheese, leaving a 1.27 cm ( 1/2-inch) border around edge. Brush
a little cold water around edge of each. Fold top of dough over filling so
that it meets the bottom edge. 

Crimp edges together with fingers and turn them up. Brush lightly with
additional oil. 

Bake until calzoni are puffy and golden brown, about 12 to 18 minutes or
until golden brown. 

Makes 2 servings.
