Ginger Chocolate Shortbread

1 cup butter, at room temperature

1/2 cup superfine sugar (I used granulated sugar ground finer with a
mortar and pestle...they suggest fruit sugar)

2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 cup finely chopped preserved ginger (NOT the same as candied ginger)

3 oz (90 g) chopped semisweet chocolate

In large bowl, using electric mixer, blend butter and sugar until fluffy.
Gradually stir in flour, then ginger and chocolate. Mixture will be
crumbly.

Divide dough in half. Form each half into smooth log about 1-1/2 inches in
diameter. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
(I made the dough the weekend before my Friday-night party, refrigerated
it, then baked on Thursday night)

Preheat oven to 300F.

Cut logs into slices about 3/8-inch thick. Place slices about 2 inches
apart on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Bake 18 to 20 minutes, or until edges
are golden, on 2 racks near centre of oven, switching racks halfway
through. (Bake in batches; keep remaining dough chilled.) Cool 10 minutes.
Transfer to wire rack to cook completely.

Makes about 50.
