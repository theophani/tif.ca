This is the simplest dressing, as long as you have the ingredients around.
Always have these ingredients around, if only to make this dressing. It turns
plain lettuce into a simple salad, tastes awesome poured on avocado or tomato
and it's yummy on fish.


Add to small glass cup:

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/8 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard OR 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
few dashes salt and pepper

Whisk with a fork until everything blends into a creamy mixture.
