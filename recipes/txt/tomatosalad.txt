Chunky Tomato Salad

1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 
2 tbsp olive oil 
1 large garlic clove, minced 
1/4 tsp each: salt, black pepper 
6 to 8 tomatoes 
1 small red onion 
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded 
1/4 cup shredded fresh basil 
1/4 to 1/2 cup chèvre (optional) 

In large mixing bowl, whisk vinegar with oil, garlic, salt and pepper. 

Core and cut tomatoes into 1-inch chunks. 

Very thinly slice onion and separate into rings.  Finely chop jalapeño. 

Add vegetables to dressing; toss gently. Leave at room temperature for up
