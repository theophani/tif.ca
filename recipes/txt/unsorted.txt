SPICY OVEN-FRIED CHICKEN

Don't be intimidated by the amount of hot pepper sauce in the marinade;
the chicken will pick up only some of the heat.

1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large onion, sliced
12 chicken pieces (breasts, thighs and drumsticks) with skin and bones 

1 cup dry unseasoned breadcrumbs
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

3 tablespoons butter, melted 

Whisk buttermilk, oil, hot pepper sauce, mustard, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt
and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl to blend well. Add onion, then
chicken and turn to coat. Cover; chill at least 3 hours or up to 1 day,
turning chicken occasionally. 

Place racks on 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Whisk breadcrumbs, cheese,
flour, thyme, paprika, cayenne and 1 teaspoon salt in large baking dish to
blend. Remove chicken from marinade, allowing excess to drip off. Add
chicken to breadcrumb mixture and turn to coat completely. Arrange
chicken, skin side up, on racks on baking sheets. Let stand 30 minutes. 

Preheat oven to 425F. Drizzle butter over chicken. Bake until crisp,
golden and cooked through, about 50 minutes. Serve warm or at room
temperature.

Makes 6 servings.
