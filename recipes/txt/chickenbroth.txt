Full-Flavoured Chicken Broth 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 tbsp vegetable oil 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 medium onion, diced 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 lb (1 1/2 kg) chicken legs or 4 lb (2 kg)
chicken backs 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8 cups water 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 tsp salt 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 bay leaves 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Heat oil in large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until it
simmers. Add onion and chicken. Cook until meat is no longer pink, about 5
to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until chicken releases
its juices, about 20 minutes. 

Increase heat to high. Add water, salt and bay leaves. As soon as water
simmers, reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until broth is rich and
flavourful, about 20 to 30 minutes longer. Strain and discard solids. 

Cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze. 

Makes 8 cups.
