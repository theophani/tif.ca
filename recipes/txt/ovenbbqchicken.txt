Oven-barbecued Chicken (from the New Joy of Cooking, page 586)

Dead easy. I recommend this recipe to everyone I know who is anxious about cooking raw meat.  
The Joy even prefaced the recipe with "This recipe could not be easier." If you're really
grossed out by even slightly bloody meat or are afraid that you're going to undercook it, I
recommend using dark meat and cooking it 10 minutes longer.  Dark meat will stay moist and
yummy even if you overcook it a bit.

-------------------------------------------

Position a rack in the centre of the oven.
Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Rinse and pat dry:
	3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds chicken parts

Season liberally with:
	salt and ground black pepper

Have ready:
	1 cup barbecue sauce
	(note from tiffany: any old sauce will do, though I prefer
	sweet "chicken and rib" style best for this recipe)

Place chicken in a shallow roasting pan of baking dish, brush with two-thirds of the sauce and
arrange skin side down in a single layer. (tiffany: line the pan with tinfoil first.  you'll
really save yourself a lot of work cleaning the damned pan afterwards). Bake for 20 minutes.  
Using tongs, turn the chicken skin side up.  Paint (or use a the back of a spoon to spread)
the remaining barbecue sauce and bake until the dark meat pieces exude clear jiuce when
pricked deeply with a fork, about 20 minutes more.

If you wish to crisp and colour the skin, run chicken briefly under a hot broiler.
