                <p>
                    I bring 20+ years of hands-on experience across software development, product management, and design. I specialize in
                    clarifying ambiguity, untangling complex systems, and driving cross-functional collaboration. Known for my pragmatism and strategic thinking,
                    I focus on scalable technical solutions that elevate team effectiveness and product impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m currently seeking a Staff Engineering role where I can apply my expertise to tackle high-leverage, cross-team
                    technical challenges. I act as a force multiplier — mentoring engineers, aligning initiatives, and advancing system-wide
                    improvements.

                    to do. I felt a lot more confident about handling similar situations more autonomously in the future.</p>
